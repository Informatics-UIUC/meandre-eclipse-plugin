TODO

#18 If a component does not have @Component annotation the Install/Find component tasks should be modified
to ask user for the RDF descriptor. Currently the process silently discards. [WILL NOT DO] -1
#19 Refractor the component into several plugins [TODO] -1
#20 Flow View -that displays the list of the flows and allows users to remove the flow [TODO] -1
#21 Flow View -that displays the list of the flows and allows users to execute the flow [TODO] -1
#22 Monitor and debug the flow execution using a declarative debugger like JIVE [EXPLORE] -1
#23 The process assumes that the component name is unique -i.e the component jar file is not tied with the component
fully qualified class name. [TODO] +1
#25 Option  of comparing the source code present in the component packaged with the one in the project. [TODO] +1
#29 Create new Meandre Component class... @Component [WILL NOT DO] -1
#32 Delete component action should first confirm. [TODO] -1
-Use /services/repository/describe_component.rdf?uri= component uri to get the rdf and then download the jar files
#38 The Tree viewer does not remember the selected item and upon refresh it should be expanded.  [BUG] 0 Not fully resolved
#42 Double click on the component jar should display the contents -class and source code in a another v
iew docked to the right [TODO] +1
#44 Ability to support multiple components java source code for installation
-instead of only one at a time. [TODO] April 10th 2008. +1
#59 Sort the components by author/data published etc. [TODO] April 16th 2008.
#61 Display Component Documentation [TODO] April 17th 2008.
#65 Support projects outside the workspace [TODO] April 20th 2008
#82 Modify the core plugin call to check if the plugin is running or not [TODO] June 10th 2008
#83 Add option to save or disable saving applet code. [TODO] June 10th 2008
#85 Before creating the component install or applet install check if the class is present in the list of jar files present
in the classpath -if so don't upload and tell the user that they already have the class in a jar
and in a classpath so it would be an error to upload the component [CRITICAL] June 13th 2008.
#87 A bug in get ComponentOuput Data type -check WekaJ48Tree component -the Model displays a java.lang.Exception [CRITICAL] June 14th 2008.
In order to recreate this issue just checkout any of the meandre component projects and try to
install the component. -[CRITICAL] -June 25th 2008
#92 I recently discovered this, suppose the Component extends an Abstract  class, the dependencies used by the
functions implemented in the  Abstract class are not discovered by the plugin. -[CRITICAL] July 4th Look at
the MonKWorksetReportComponent.

#99 Check if the @Component.name is correct -if missing the process just bombs without any error message.

#105 Annotation for signed jars?? perhaps an annotation to specify the cert file[TODO] October 3rd 2008 Loretta
[WILL NOT DO]: This is a bit of a task with low returns. If someone wants to use the signed components -they
could use the manager interface. The plugin can be still used to create RDF and generate the jar dependency
list and the package jar file.
#107 Change find to install in the wizard that installs the components once it has found the components to install [TODO] October 3rd 2008 Loretta
[WIll NOT DO]: The plugin has three steps; what you are asking requires me to remove the last step; It can be done
but is a bit of a task and I am not sure if it is all that useful.
#108 Updated to  Meandre Server 1.4 alpha -Breaks compatiability with previous versions [DONE] November 20th 2008
#126 When the component extends an abstract class -the datatyping and Input/Output/Property data types and names are missing [Critical] July 14th 2009
