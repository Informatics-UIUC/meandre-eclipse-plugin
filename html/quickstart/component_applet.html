  <h3>Installing Meandre Component With Applet</h3>
	<p>
	To Install a component with an applet, use the <i>@ComponentNatures</i> annotation. It provides an array of  <i>@ComponentNature</i> annotations (you can use <i>@ComponentNature</i> by 
	itself -that would work as well), the extClass attribute is the applet's main class. The dependency attribute should only include jar files 
	that cannot be auto discovered by jarjar library because of reasons such as Class.forName use in the applet. In the example below  
	com.applet.FooApplet.class is the Applet's main class (class with applet lifecycle functions), the dependency jar 
   "mysql-connector-java-3.0.15-ga-bin.jar" is used by the applet and is not autodetected by the jarjar library, and it needs to be 
   included in the dependency list. This applet class might depend upon any number of other jars and other classes, those would be packaged along 
   with the jar applet as a component dependency automatically by the plugin.
   <br/>
   You can have multiple applets in the same component and the plugin would package each in separate jar file. The name of the 
   applet jar by convention is    Class.getName().replace(".class").append(".jar").toLowerCase(), in the example below the packaged 
   applet jar file will be named <b>org.monkproject.meandre.components.tests.fooapplet.jar</b>
	
	
	You would need to add the applet jar depdendencies to the projects classpath, and the applet should compile in the current project
	classpath. Do not use the  <i>@Component.dependency</i> attribute to list those dependencies. 
	Add the applet jar dependencies that cannot be auto discovered in the <i>@ComponentNature.dependency</i> attribute and the files 
	such as images and resources reqired by the applet in the resources attribute 
	are all added to the component jar file. See the example below.

	<h4>Applet with many images and other resources -How can you install without listing each one in the resource array?</h4>
	<p>
	If an applet uses many images and resources like property files, velocity templates etc. It would be easier to jar those resources and add that 
	jar to the eclipse classpath and list the jar file name as a dependency in the @ComponentNature.dependency array.
	In your applet use getClass().getResourceAsInputStream() to get the bytes and convert that into an imageicon or read it as a property file. 
	The plugin does not create the jar file automatically for these resources -you would have to create the jar and add it to the 
	project classpath and list it in the dependency attribute.
